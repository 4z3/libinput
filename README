This library does processing on input device events while providing an API
to the the user used for delegating more useful input events.

Input event processing includes scaling touch coordinates, generating
pointer events from touchpads, pointer acceleration, etc.

It is based on the input code from the weston Wayland reference compositor.

It has no other dependencies than libmtdev and supports only evdev devices.
